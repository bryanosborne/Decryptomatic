# Decryptomatic

Wizard of Oz Solutions just realized that now it has an encryption program, it will need a decryption program as well!

You have been tasked with the assignment to create a program that will decrypt messages encrypted using the Caesar Cipher program we created.

The decryption program must be able to decrypt encrypted messages written in uppercase letters.

Create pseudocode first and then use it for your comments.

Program should provide instructions and appropriate user prompts for encrypted text and the cipher key.
